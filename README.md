# b00b69
b00b69 is a custom VS Code theme I made where most of the colors are derived from #b00b69 (Dark Pink)

This isn't an extension (yet), so for the time being you'll have to copy/paste the code into your ```settings.json``` file.

Instructions:
* Hit Ctrl+Shift+P to open the command palette and type ```Preferences: Open User Settings (JSON)``` and select the option. This will open a ```settings.json``` file.
* Copy the code from [this](https://github.com/Demkeys/b00b69/blob/main/settings.json) file into your ```settings.json``` file, within the existing curly braces. You have to take care of JSON syntax while doing this. So if there's existing code within the curly braces, remember to add a comma and then paste the theme code. See the sample file 
* Save the file and if there are no errors the theme should take effect.

I'll be working on this theme over time, tweaking values and adding settings as necesary. I made this for my own use, so didn't bother creating an extension out of it. If there's a lot of people interested in it, I might consider making it an extension, but for now just copying and pasting this code works just fine. Enjoy!
